# ows4R
R client for OGC Web-Services

``ows4R`` is a new project that aims to set-up a pure R interface to OGC Web-Services. In a first time (ongoing work), ``ows4R`` will target:
* the Common OGC Web-Services specifications
* the Web Feature Service (WFS), with support for all versions (_i.e._ ``1.0.0``, ``1.1.0``, and ``2.0.0``).
